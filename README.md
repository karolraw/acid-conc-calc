<b>Warning!!</b> Currently the results are accurate only for 20Â°C. Please keep this in mind as it might generate some error when you prepare solutions in different temperatures. 

## Why use the calculator?

Imagine you're an analytical chemist preparing an acid solution. You have a rough idea of the required volume and know the target concentration. However, the only available acids are in their original concentrated forms. This calculator helps you quickly determine how much acid to measure before diluting it in a volumetric flask.

## How to use the calculator? 
<b>Step 1</b>: Simply clone the code in <u>calculator.py</u> and run it in your console or IDE. The window should pop up right away.

<b>Step 2</b>: In the "Concentrated Acid" section, select the acid.

<b>Step 3 (optional)</b>: Adjust the density, percentage concentration, and molar mass based on the information from the acid bottle label or another source.  

<b>Step 4</b>: In the "Target Solution" section, enter the desired concentration of your diluted solution. Select whether the concentration is in g/mol or % using the corresponding radio button on the right.

<b>Step 5</b>: Enter the target solution volume (in liters) and click "Calculate". A new window will display the procedure for preparing the acid solution.
